c2nim 
nimgen -> might be nifty

- nice syntactic sugar#

deefer is really nice

templates DSL -> might turn out to be useful
Macro 

# Day two 
Convert ugly unsemantic 

sprintf(json,"{\"type\":\"%s\",\"code\":\"%s\"}",	keyup?"keyup":"keydown", key);

write is always easier than parse, could you say that??

    var dir = if down == 1:"keydown" 
        else : "keyup"

    let resp = %* {"type": dir, "code": $code, "key": $key}

easier to parse and as such to debug
