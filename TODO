When the NimMain() function is called Nim initializes the garbage collector to the current thread, which is usually the main thread of your application. If your C code later spawns a different thread and calls Nim code, the garbage collector will fail to work properly and you will crash.

As long as you don't use the threadvar emulation Nim uses native thread variables, of which you get a fresh version whenever you create a thread. You can then attach a GC to this thread via

system.setupForeignThreadGc()
It is not safe to disable the garbage collector and enable it after the call from your background thread even if the code you are calling is short lived.

Before the thread exits, you should tear down the thread's GC to prevent memory leaks by calling

system.tearDownForeignThreadGc()
